# Camerotator
Have you ever wanted to feel stupid while in a video call? Do you feel unhappy, knowing that your camera doesn't continuously rotate like no one else in the world? Well, Camerotator©®™ is a free open source program that grabs your webcam with cv, rotates it, then sends it back through pyvirtualcam!
